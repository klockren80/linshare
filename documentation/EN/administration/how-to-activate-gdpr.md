Hence, data such as **first name**, **last name**, **mail** will be anonymized after one year of inactivity in LinShare.

- any first name, last name or email used by the sharing feature or the upload request features (actors, owners, senders, recipients, ...) stored in the audit
- any first name, last name or email used by the sharing feature or the upload request features collected and store for favorite recipients or auto complete purpose.

# This cron is responsible of :
#   - executing task populating gdpr garbage collector
job.gdpr.cron.expression=0 0 4 * * ?
linshare.gdpr.enable=true
