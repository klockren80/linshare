## Outcome and activities

| Outcomes | Activities | Participants |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| **A prioritized technical backlog** <br/> From the Product Owner, Engineering Team should be aware of the prioritized topics for the development process | - From the list of user stories with the label `STORY::READY`, a series of technical issues are established. all developers must subscribe to this label to get updates. <br/> - Technical issues must be linked with corresponding Story issues (using "Linked issues" module), `Development:xxx` labels must be added to the story to identify the needs. (Refer to [Development labels](##development-labels)) <br/> - `BACKEND:xxx` and/org`FRONTEND:xxx` labels must also be added to materialize the progress of this achievement. (Refer to [Development state labels](##development-state-labels)). Frontend developers should subscribe to `BACKEND:READY` label to get updates.  <br/> - Once we start working on a tech issue, STORY must be updated with label to `STORY::IMPLEMENTING`.<br/> - After a user story is implemented, update the story issue label to `STORY::IMPLEMENTED` <br/> - Notify the QA department to start testing process | Engineering Team (specifically current Scrum Master or Lead Developer) |
| **A series of test criteria** <br/> These activities are commenced right when user stories are finished | - For each user stories, QA personnel in charge at the moment will create a series of test critera | QA Department |
| **Stable feature, ready for release** <br/> These activities start after a feature is implemented from Engineering Team | - In case of any issue regarding the implemented user story, QA personnel will create an issue in linshare-qa repository. <br/> - Issues must be well defined, using provided template, labelled accordingly. (Refer to [Severity labels](##severity-labels)) <br/> - Dev team  will analyze the issue in QA board and add one state label (Refer to [State labels](##state-labels)), and then, if needed, create technical issues in the related repository <br/> - Dev team will update the QA issue according to the related component, f.i backend issue with `DEVELOPMENT::core`, frontend web app with `DEVELOPMENT::ui`, <br/> - Then the PO must define the priority and the target of the issue, ie in which versions this issue must be fixed, <br/> - Once the technical issues are handled, developers must update the QA issue status to `To Do` <br/> - When the issue is fixed or implemented, satisfying the definition of done. QA personnel will then close the issue | Engineering Team, QA Department |


> At the first daily of the week, each week, two members of the Dev team, one front, one back, will be chosen to review the QA board and analyse issues.

## Development rules

* Once the technical issue is created, severity, priority and target labels must be set according to the QA issue (if they are defined)
* For each merge request, we must set the milestone field according to the release, ex "LinShare release 4.1.3" or "LinShare release 4.0.4".
* Once the QA issues have been reviewed and technical issues created, dev team must assign the QA issue to the PO, then he will be able to set TARGET and PRIORITY labels.


## Releases

### Milestones and labels

Before planning a new release for a component, a new "LinShare release x.y.z" milesone must be created as long as its related TARGET label.
For the version 4.1.3, we must create the label TARGET:4.1.3 and the milestone "LinShare release 4.1.3".

Once a component is released, all closed issues marked with the label TARGET:4.1.3 must be updated with the milestone "LinShare release 4.1.3".
 

Once the sprint is completed, the PO updates the milestone field with "LinShare release" milestone according to the higher target label. ie: if an issue has the target 4.0.4 and 4.1.3, the milestone value will be "LinShare release 4.1.3".
