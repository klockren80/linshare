> Note :
 - We explain in this file how to upgrade your LinShare's version. </br>
 - Please note that all the components found in each LinShare's version
(http://download.linshare.org/versions/{VERSION}) must be upgraded together.  
Each LinShare version folder, contains the dependencies required to install the version properly. </br>
- You can find the required versions of LinShare's dependencies [here](../installation/requirements.md)

## Required artifacts

</a>


In this new version of LinShare a new admin interface is introduced, so we will need two ui-admin components (old component and new one), as it will be explained later.
Our goal for the future is to implement all features in the old interface into the new one.

For this migration, download the following files from this address: http://download.linshare.org/versions/6.0.2 :

  * __linshare-core-6.0.2.war__

  * __linshare-ui-admin-6.0.2.tar.bz2__

  * __linshare-ui-admin-4.2.7-legacy1.tar.bz2__

  * __linshare-ui-user-6.0.2.tar.bz2__

  * __linshare-ui-upload-request-6.0.2.tar.bz2__

> Note :</br>
 - In this upgrade guide we suppose that all components are downloaded on `/root/downloads` directory</br>

 <a name="backup">

 ## Backups :

 </a>

 To avoid any side effect of these critical operations, it is better to store a backup of your databases `PostgreSQL` and `MongoDB`.

 > Note :</br>
In this upgrade guide we consider that the default databases PostgreSQL and MongoDB are named `linshare`

 To do that please execute these commands :

  * Postgres `linshare` dump:

  ```bash
         pg_dump -h `host` -p `port` -U linshare -W  -f dump-linshare.sql
```

  * MongoDb `linshare` dump:

  For mongo you can just dump `linshare` database and avoid dumping `linshare-files` because it contains only thumbnail and mail attachments, it won't be impacted by the upgrade process.

```bash
         mongodump --host `host` --port `port` --db=linshare
```


 First you need to stop Apache and Tomcat services:

 ```bash
 $ systemctl stop apache2
 ```
 ```bash
 $ systemctl stop tomcat9.service
 ```  


The next step, you should replace the `linShare.war` with `LinShare-core-6.0.0.war`:

 ```bash
 $ rm /var/lib/tomcat9/webapps/linshare.war
 $ rm -fr /var/lib/tomcat9/webapps/linshare
 $ cp  /root/downloads/linshare-core-6.0.2.war /var/lib/tomcat9/webapps/linshare.war
 ```



 ```bash
 $ systemctl start tomcat9.service
 ```

 <a name="ui-admin">

## Upgrade UI applications
In this versions we've changed the format for the URLs of the SPA applications to remove '#' symbol from URLs due to 
some of the OIDC providers don't support it in the callback urls. So you will need to change your Apache configuration 
and add a rewrite rule to serve index.html for every path except static resources.

### LinShare-ui-admin Apache configuration
```apache
<Directory /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/linshare-ui-admin/new>
      RewriteEngine on
      RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f [OR]
      RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d
      RewriteRule ^ - [L]
      RewriteRule ^ index.html [L]
    </Directory>
```

### LinShare-ui-user Apache configuration
```apache
<Directory /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/linshare-ui-user>
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteBase /
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f [OR]
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d
    RewriteRule ^ - [L]
    RewriteRule ^ index.html [L]
</Directory>
```

 ## Upgrade LinShare-ui-admin

 </a>


 As mentioned before for application __LinShare UI Admin__ we will need two components, you can follow the steps bellow to deploy them in the apache2 repository :

 ```
 $ cd /var/www/
 $ rm -rf linshare-ui-admin
 $ tar xjvf /root/downloads/linshare-ui-admin-4.2.7-legacy1.tar.bz2
 $ chown -R www-data: linshare-ui-admin
 $ cd linshare-ui-admin
 $ tar xjf /tmp/linshare_data/linshare-ui-admin-6.0.2.tar.bz2
 $ mv linshare-ui-admin new

 ```


 <a name="ui-user">

 ## Upgrade LinShare-ui-user
 </a>

 Deploy the archive of the application __LinShare UI User__ in the Apache2 repository :

 ```
 $ cd /var/www/
 $ rm -rf linshare-ui-user
 $ tar xjvf  /root/downloads/linshare-ui-user-6.0.2.tar.bz2
 $ chown -R www-data: linshare-ui-user
 ```

 <a name="ui-upload-request">

 ## Upgrade LinShare-ui-upload-request
 </a>

 Deploy the archive of the application __LinShare UI Upload Request__ in the Apache2 repository :

 ```
 $ cd /var/www/
 $ rm -rf linShare-ui-upload-request
 $ tar xjvf  /root/downloads/linshare-ui-upload-request-6.0.2.tar.bz2
 $ chown -R www-data: linshare-ui-upload-request
 ```

 Now you can start your Apache service again.

 ```
 $ systemctl start apache2
 ```
