   - Default value: include a text box that only contain number and a dropdown-list with option: day/week/month
   - Max value: include a text box that only contain number and a dropdown-list with option: day/week/month
     - or I can select a checkbox unlimited for max value. 

**UC2. User UI**
* Given that I am a LinShare user and the Functionalities "Share expiration" is enabled in Admin UI
* when i try to share a file in LinShare, on Quick Share screen, I can see the field :" Expiration date"
* If the Delegation policy of Share expiration in Admin is disabled, the value of this field is defined = current date + default value of Share expiration. And user cannot change this value
* If the Delegation policy of Share expiration in Admin is enabled, the value of this field is defined as :
