### Preconditions

- Given that I (the user) already have LinShare log-in credentials from the user provider (LDAP)

### Description 

- When I open LinShare UI-User URL of my company, I can see a log-in screen:
- The log-in screen includes fields: 
   - Email: A text field and mandatory 
   - Password: A text field and mandatory 
   - Keep me Signed-in: A checkbox
   - Forgot password: A link 
- After input fields, I click Log-in button, the system will validate:
   - If field email or password is blank, there will be an error message: This field cannot be blank (error1)
   - If email format is invalid, there will be an error message: Invalid email format (error 2)

- If there is no error, I am logged-in successfully to LinShare 
- IF the email or password is incorrect, there will be an error message: Authentication failed, either the email or the password is invalid. 
- If the authentication is failed for multiple times, the account will be locked by following rules :
   * After 3 attempts : account locked for 10 minutes
   * After 6 attempts : account locked for 20 minutes
   * After 9 attempts : account locked for 60 minutes (1 hour)
   * After 12 attempts : account locked for 1440 minutes (1 day)
   * After 15 attempts : account locked indefinitely

- Error (1) and error (2) are not counted as failed authentication 
- When account is locked, I can see a message: "Your account has been locked for [locked time] due to failed login attempts"

### Postcondition 

- If I input correct log-in credentials, I am logged in and  redirected to LinShare homepage. 
- The system should create a LinShare user account for me if I do not already have one. 

**NB: Possibility for the user to change logo, background images and colors : We will have a dedicated story for this
