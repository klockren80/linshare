## Related EPIC


## Definition

- On the web login page, there is a checkbox "Keep me signed in" 
- I select the checkbox "Keep me signed in" option and successfully logs in, the application should securely store the session information.
- When I opens the website next time, either by reopening the browser or returning after closing the session, should result in automatic sign-in without the need to re-enter login credentials.
- If I manually logs out, the "Keep me signed in" preference is reset, requiring manual login on the next visit.
